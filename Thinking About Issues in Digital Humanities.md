# Discussing Drawbacks to Digital History


One of the most interesting annotations I've seen in the course of this class is one by Angela Chiesa on Tim Hitchcock's article, [*Big Data for Dead People*](http://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html#annotations:E8DZuGTiEee8E8eLrn_ajQ). In this [annotation](https://hyp.is/E8DZuGTiEee8E8eLrn_ajQ/historyonics.blogspot.com/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html) Chiesa postulates that because of the high numbers of internet users that it is possible that a mass migration to digital platforms would mean the publication of incorrect information. I think this is an interesting comment because it brings up a possible issue with the discipline of digital humanities. It is important to address issues with the burgeoning field as it is all to easy to see it as pure, glorious innovation which will change the face of history forever.

Chiesa describes [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) as being one of the perpetrators of this kind of misinformation. There is an argument, I think, for more content equaling more error. However I think that there is also a case for more users and more exposure of text meaning that there is a higher scrutiny of the content which is being presented. 

Caleb McDaniel, in his [article supporting open research for historians](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html), has presented the digital humanities as being a way to introduce more accountability for scholars. McDaniel believes that because the resources of scholars can  be examined at a click, this makes checking the authenticity of research less labour intensive and thus means that publications with open research are more credible. However, Melissa Terras describes an experience which shows several problems in the publication of the digital humanities. In her article entitled [*Why I do not trust Frontiers journals, especially not @FrontDigitalHum*](https://melissaterras.org/2015/07/21/why-i-do-not-trust-frontiers-journals-especially-not-frontdigitalhum/#annotations:6AcX3GTdEeemnJ9kFaKK7g), Terras explains the issues of discredibility and academic dishonesty as well as underrepresentation in the Frontiers in Digital Humanities Journal (see the journal's predominately male [editorial board](http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/digital-humanities#editorial-board) for proof of underrepresentation of women in the journal). These two differing perspectives show both the ways digital humanities can aid in ligitimacy and hinder it.
